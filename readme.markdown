# node-mail-relay

> use gmail with your custom domain for free

- SMTP server on port 587 for outgoing emails (set up your mail client to use this as a custom SMTP server)
- SMTP server on port 25 for incoming emails (forwards emails to you based on `MAIL_MAP`)

## _warning_

This stuff is _experimental_. Use with caution.

## install

```sh
$ npm i -g mail-relay
```

## usage

```sh
$ mail-relay
```

In order to bind to port `25` and `587`, you need to be `root` or you have to add `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` to `mail-relay`. If you are concerned, run it as root, and drop privileges after start with [`SETUID`](#setuid).

A full configuration example:

```sh
$ AUTH_USER=foo \
  AUTH_PASS=bar \
  MAIL_MAP='{"john@doe.com":"johndoe@gmail.com"}' \
  SETUID=99 \
  mail-relay
```

## configuration

With env vars.

### `AUTH_USER`

User for the outgoing emails.

### `AUTH_PASS`

Password for the outgoing emails.

### `MAIL_MAP`

Address mapping

```js
{
  "john@doe.com": "johndoe@gmail.com"
}
```

### `MAIL_FILTER_SOURCE`

Reject sources matching this pattern. If you are in control of `doe.com`, then you should probably reject mails coming from `@doe\.com$`.

### `SETUID`

Set `uid` after ports are bound (ie. you no longer run as `root`).
You probably want to set it to `$(id -u nobody)` (which is `65534` or `99` or something else, depending on your system).
